<h1>Wow look at me I am a component</h1>
<p>State transitions don't HAVE to always be done using ui-sref. You can initiate a state transition from a
function in your controller if you want to by calling $state.go()</p>
<button class="btn btn-primary" ng-click="$ctrl.goToState()">f() {$state.go('.component2')}</button>
<div ui-view></div>
